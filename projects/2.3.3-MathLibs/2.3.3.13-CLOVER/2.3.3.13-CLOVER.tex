\subsubsection{\stid{3.13} CLOVER} 
Mathematical libraries are powerful tools to make better use of Exascale 
architectural features and are central for application projects to efficiently 
exploit the available computing power. The high-level objective of CLOVER is to 
provide scalable, portable numerical algorithms that facilitate efficient 
application simulations on Exascale computers. With the intention of generating synergies 
by facilitating vivid cooperation among the distinct project focus efforts 
and expert knowledge transfer, CLOVER was designed as a merger of the SLATE, 
Ginkgo, and heFFTe projects, each being complementary 
in focus but similar in the need for hardware-specific algorithm design 
expertise: SLATE focuses on Exascale-capable dense linear algebra 
functionality; Ginkgo delivers production-ready, preconditioned iterative solvers for 
GPU-accelerated systems;
heFFTeâ€™s scope is providing robust and fast calculation for 2D 
and 3D FFT routines. Together, these projects form a robust ecosystem of numerical 
base functionality for Exascale computers.
