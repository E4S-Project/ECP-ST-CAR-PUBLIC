ECP ST efforts contribute to the HPC software ecosystem in a variety of ways. The most tangible way was to include contributions to software products, many of which are already widely deployed and being transformed for use with exascale systems.  However, the ECP ST contributes to industry and de facto standards efforts.  Finally, some ECP ST efforts contribute to the upstream processes of requirements, analysis, design, and prototyping that inform the implementation of vendor and other third-party software products.  Although they do not receive the most attention, these upstream efforts are very impactful and low cost without a product to support.
