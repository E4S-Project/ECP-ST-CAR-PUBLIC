abstract="Heterogeneous computing has emerged as a promising fit for scientific domains such as molecular dynamics simulations, bioinformatics, weather prediction. Such a computing paradigm includes x86 processors coupled with GPUs, FPGAs, DSPs or a coprocessor paradigm that takes advantage of all the cores and caches on a single die such as the Knights Landing. OpenACC, a high-level directive-based parallel programming model has emerged as a programming paradigm that can tackle the intensity of heterogeneity in architectures. Data-driven large scientific codes are increasingly using OpenACC, which makes it essential to analyze the accuracy of OpenACC compilers while they port code to various types of platforms. In response, we have been creating a validation suite to validate and verify the implementations of OpenACC features in conformance with the specification. The validation suite also provides a tool to compiler developers as a standard for the compiler to be tested against and to users and compiler developers alike in clarifying the OpenACC specification. This testsuite has been integrated into the harness infrastructure of the TITAN and Summitdev systems at Oak Ridge National Lab and is being used for production.",
