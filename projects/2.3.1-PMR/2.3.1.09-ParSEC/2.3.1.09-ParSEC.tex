\subsubsection{\stid{1.09} Distributed Tasking at Exascale: PaRSEC}


\paragraph{Overview}

The PaRSEC Environment provides a software ecosystem composed of a runtime
component to dynamically execute task-based applications on heterogeneous
distributed systems, and a productivity toolbox that comprises a development
framework for the support of multiple domain specific languages (DSLs) and
extensions, with debugging, trace collection, and analysis tools.
%
The PaRSEC project team is dedicated to solving two challenging and
interdependent problems facing the ECP developer community: First, how to create
an execution model that enables developers to express as much parallelism as
possible in their applications, so that applications effectively utilize the
massive collection of heterogeneous devices ECP machines will deploy. Second,
how to ensure the execution model is flexible and portable enough to actually
provide and sustain a performance benefit by increasing the scientific
productivity of the application developers, not only for the ECP target
environments but for the foreseeable future.

PaRSEC is an open source, community-based implementation of a generic task-based
runtime that is freely available, and used by an increasing number of software
libraries.
%  The PARSEC development team is mainly comprised of research staff at % UTK,
%  but regular contributions from the community are provided via our presence %
%  on GitHub and Bitbucket.
The project focuses on providing a stable and efficient infrastructure for quick
prototyping of different approaches to define task-based languages able to
exploit the full range of capabilities of Exascale platforms. Without such a
project, and based on the current state of task-based runtimes, potential users
will be stuck either in fixed programming paradigms, or with a particular,
potentially less efficient, mix of programming languages. The DTE project
provides means to maintain a high competitiveness in the field leading to more
innovation on addressing the challenges we are facing toward scalable,
performant and Exascale ready programming paradigms.

\paragraph{Key Challenges}
%\textit{Describe what is hard to do, why it is challenging.}

As Exascale platforms delivery become a closer deadline, a increasing number of
aspects of the hardware and software environment still pose challenges. First
and foremost, keeping pace with the architectural changes on current and future
platforms requires changes not only on how we take advantage of the hardware
capabilities, but how we reshape our algorithms and applications to expose
enough parallelism to maximize the use of the underlying hardware. The number of
nodes, threads per node, memory hierarchies and support for increased
computational capabilities (accelerators) will continue to increase, while the
currently available programming paradigms are still struggling with parallelism
at the node level.

\paragraph{Solution Strategy}
%\textit{Describe your basic strategy for addressing the challenges.}
The approach followed in PaRSEC is to provide a low-level, flexible and dynamic
runtime able not only to schedule tasks at the node level, but to handle data
transfers between different memory (both inter and intra nodes), memory
hierarchies, heterogeneous architectures with support for accelerators with a
simple programming scheme. The proposed approach envisions a middle-ground
solution, addressing both hardware and software challenges. At the hardware
level a team of dedicated developers extends PaRSEC to map it's capabilities to
the hardware and to improve it's scalability and performance. At the upper
software level the runtime interactions are through Domain Specific Languages
with the target domain scientists in mind, that will facilitate the expression
of algorithmic parallelism with familiar constructs mapped on the exposed
low-level capabilities. To facilitate the integration of PaRSEC-driven libraries
into larger and complex applications, PaRSEC natively interoperate with other
programming paradigms, including some target of the ECP PMR support, such as
PGAS, MPI, OpenMP and Kokkos. This integration provides a smooth transition for
library developers that embrace the PaRSEC runtime, providing a platform where a
shift to a new programming paradigms can be done in stages of increased
complexity~\cite{lorapo-protools,BLR_LU,parsec_pdgemm}.
% In this model, PaRSEC remains in full control of data tracking and
% allocation on the managed accelerator.

\paragraph{Recent Progress}

The software release (2019.11) provides many new additions to the low-level task
runtime, supports for a number of hardware capabilities (GPU, NVLink, P9 atomic
ops), brings significant improvements to the performance and scalability of the
runtime, and addresses many pending issues.
%
% The installation system has been improved to take advantage of the latest
% capability of CMake, and scripts for seamless integration in the ECP software
% ecosystem (via SPack). Significant improvements have also been added on the
% performance and scalability of the runtime, as shown by the results below.
%
On the software quality side, the PaRSEC runtime has been evaluated and amended
to compile and run on all pre-Exascale platforms (ALCF Mira, Theta; OLCF
Summit). PaRSEC now includes a Spack definition file to ease the deployment on
future target systems as part of the system software SDK effort.

\caption{Strong-scaling performance of the matrix-matrix multiplication
(PDGEMM)\label{fig:PDGEMM}} \end{wrapfigure} The DTE GPU support engine has been
refactored, addressing some of the existing limitations in data management
(allocation and transfer), and adding support for NVLink capabilities to
minimize the transfer cost between GPUs on the same node. All these improvements
have enabled unprecedented performance on distributed, multi-GPU platforms for
real applications.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:PDGEMM} shows a strong scaling performance of PDGEMM from our
DPLASMA math library using PaRSEC to power one of the most compute intensive
operation and study the implementation scalability with an increasing problem
and number of computing elements size. This integration illustrates the runtime
capability to obtain high efficiency for such operation independent on the
number of resources involved in the computation, even in scenarios where the
memory required for the storage of the matrices is larger than the total amount
of memory available on the GPU. A pro-active data transfer management system and
an efficient data transfer mechanisms are some of the PaRSEC underlying features
that enable such level of performance.

An important aspect of the DTE project is to define and prototype scalable
domain specific languages that enable a productive expression of parallelism for
end-user communities. PaRSEC presents multiple programming interfaces
(Parameterized Task Graphs for maximum parallelism, the popular serial task
insertion dataflow model to provide direct access to the runtime). In addition
the DTE team is in close contact with application teams to define parallel
abstractions that are suitable for their domain usage. Notably, the PaRSEC team
has ongoing collaboration with the SLATE linear algebra package and NWChemEx and
GAMESS chemistry package teams. The PaRSEC development team did the first step
toward the integration of their framework into the SLATE (2.3.3.09) in the
context of the shared milestone (STPM11-23). The first prototype of the
application ran in a distributed environment and showed the capability of the
SLATE library using a modern fully capable runtime system. This work involved
enhancing the insert task interface available in the ParSEC runtime to map onto
the logic of a SLATE algorithm.

           SLATE and ScaLAPACK on 64 nodes 12 cores each\label{fig:slate-parsec}}
\end{wrapfigure}
%
In figure~\ref{fig:slate-parsec}, we compare the integration of SLATE
and PaRSEC against the state of the art. First against the two legacy
domain specific languages that have the capability to do linear
algebra; then against the regular SLATE using OpenMP for intra-node
parallelism, and MPI for communication; and finally against ScaLAPACK,
which is the reference for distributed linear algebra.


\paragraph{Next Steps}
%\textit{Describe what you are working on next.}
% Improve DTE accelerator support and interoperability with other
% programming models
To provide programmers with more supervision over how accelerators are
integrated and used by the runtime, a need to provide finer control of the
resource usage by the runtime system has arisen. We are developing new APIs to
allow the programmers to advise the runtime system with respect to data
placement, prefetching, and management of cache.
%
Programming interoperability should not be limited to node-level programming
models but should extend to distributed programming. Execution modes where part
of the application is expressed in native MPI (including communicating tasks)
and other parts using PaRSEC DSLs, running above the task system in a tightly
coupled manner, are being developed.

% Facilitate DSL integration

% Provide better libraries and tools integration
The set of tools that come with the PaRSEC runtime environment to
assess performance, find bottlenecks, improve scheduling and debug the
task-based application are being improved to expose the information
in a format compatible with TAU, Score-P and other
tools that are already familiar to ECP users.
