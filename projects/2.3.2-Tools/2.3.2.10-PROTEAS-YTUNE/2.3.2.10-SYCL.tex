\paragraph{Overview}


\paragraph{Key Challenges}


\paragraph{Solution Strategy}


\paragraph{Recent Progress}


\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Data compression and encryption}
  Added data compression and encryption to Papyrus~\cite{Kim:2019:IED}.
  Our compression technique exploits deep memory hierarchy in an HPC system to achieve both storage reduction and performance improvement.
  Our encryption technique provides a practical level of security and enables sharing of sensitive data securely in complex scientific workflows with nearly imperceptible cost.
\item \textbf{Redesign}
  Redesigned and optimized Papyrus to support multidimensional tables.
\item \textbf{Summit}
  Performed preliminary evaluation on OLCF's Summit supercomputer.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Next Steps}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Versioning} Versioning can be used to provide new levels of reliability and performance optimization. We will design and implement versioning in Papyrus.

\item \textbf{Performance optimization} New APIs and hardware support is being developed for NVM technologies; we are implementing optimizations in Papyrus to take advantage of these advances.

\end{enumerate}
