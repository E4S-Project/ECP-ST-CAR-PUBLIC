\subsubsection{\stid{5.01} Software Development Kits} \label{subsubsect:ecosystem-sdk}

\paragraph{Overview} The ST SDK project supports a set of activities focused on 
\begin{itemize}
\item establishing Community Policies aimed at increasing the interoperability between and sustainability of ST software packages, using the xSDK~\cite{xsdk:homepage} community package and installation policies~\cite{xsdk-policies:homepage} as a model.
\item coordinating the delivery of ECP ST products through the E4S~\cite{e4s:homepage}, a comprehensive and coherent set of software tools, to all interested stakeholders on behalf of ECP ST, including ECP applications and the broader open source community.
\end{itemize}

An ECP ST SDK is a collection of related software products (called packages) where coordination across package teams will improve usability and practices and foster community growth among teams that develop similar and complementary capabilities.  SDKs have the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Domain scope: Collection makes functional sense.
\item Interaction model: How packages interact; compatible, complementary, interoperable.
\item Community policies: Value statements; serve as criteria for membership.
\item Community interaction: Communication between teams. Bridge culture. Common vocabulary.
\item Meta-infrastructure: Encapsulates, invokes build of all packages (Spack), shared test suites.
\item Coordinated plans: Inter-package planning. Does not replace autonomous package planning.
\item Community outreach: Coordinated, combined tutorials, documentation, best practices.
\end{itemize}

The SDK project is needed within ECP because it will make it simpler for ECP applications to access required software dependencies on ECP target platforms and drastically lower the cost of exploring the use of additional ECP ST software that may be of benefit. In addition, the SDK effort will decrease the ECP software support burden at the major computing facilities by ensuring the general compatibility of ST packages within a single software environment, providing tool support for the installation of ST packages on facility machines, communicating common requirements for ST software and facilitating the set up of CI testing at the Facilities. This project works closely with the HI 2.4.4 \textit{Deployment of Software at the Facilities} project.

\paragraph{Key  Challenges}
ST software packages have been developed in a variety of very different cultures and are at significantly different levels of software engineering maturity and sophistication. The experience of some of the SDK staff during the formation of the xSDK showed that in this situation, it is challenging to establish common terminology and effective communication, and these are prerequisites to community policies and a robust software release.

Deciding exactly how to deploy the SDKs at the Facilities is itself a challenge. ECP applications will use different combinations of ST software in different configurations. For example, applications will want mathematical libraries capabilities from the xSDK build on top of both MPICH and OpenMPI, and will want different configurations of those mathematical libraries.

\paragraph{Solution Strategy}
The SDK solution strategy involves pursuing interoperability and sustainability goals by grouping ST software projects into logical collections whose members will benefit from a common set of community policies as well as increased communication between members to standardize approaches where sensible and establish better software practices. 

The SDK effort will also facilitate the use of common infrastructure, such as CI testing at the major computing Facilities and the Spack~\cite{gamblin+:sc15} package manager. SDK release and delivery goals will benefit from common package manager and testing infrastructure, including the E4S initiative to provide prebuilt binaries for a variety of architectures.

Recognizing the release readiness and broader maturity differences between ECP ST products, the release strategy has been to include only those products ready for a joint release in the E4S releases, but to also continue to work with other products in preparing for subsequent release opportunities.

\paragraph{Recent Progress}

E4S release 1.0 was announced in November 2019 on the external E4S website~\cite{e4s:homepage}. The release supports 50 ST products under Linux x86\_64. In February 2020, E4S release 1.1 extended support to both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs with the inclusion of CUDA and ROCm in a single image under Linux x86\_64. Release 1.1 also introduced support for the Linux ppc64le platform that supports CUDA 10.1. E4S releases contain HPC as well as AI/ML software including TensorFlow and PyTorch. The E4S DocPortal, accessible from the E4S website, was created to rake information from E4S product GitHub pages and provide it in a single location with the most up-to-date information about releases, installation instructions, etc. The E4S validation testsuite~\cite{e4s:validation} was introduced with support for LLVM and other ST products.

In August 2021, E4S v21.08 included x86\_64 and ppc64le Docker and Singularity images with 88 E4S products. It included the DOE fork of LLVM compilers as well as E4S products built using these compilers. E4S images with support for three GPU architectures (Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA) are now available for download on DockerHub under the ecpe4s area and are released on the E4S website. These images support Intel oneAPI, AMD ROCm, and NVIDIA NVHPC and CUDA. The E4S Spack Build Cache now includes binaries for ppc64le as well as x86\_64 and includes over 53,000 total binaries (see Figure~\ref{fig:e4s-build-cache}. E4S containers now support custom images for ECP applications such as WDMapp (see Figure~\ref{fig:SpackBuildCacheWDMapp}), Nalu-Wind (see Figure~\ref{fig:E4SImageOnAWS}, and the Pantheon project (see Figure~\ref{fig:PantheonE4S}). The WBS 2.3.6.01 LANL ATDM Software Technologies project highlights the integration of Nalu-Wind and Cinema in a curated Pantheon workflow using an E4S build cache. The E4S build cache has improved the build times for these codes significantly.

E4S is also deployed on AWS and is used for outreach activities including tutorials at conferences such as ISC-HPC and SC. Figure~\ref{fig:E4SImageOnAWS} shows the output of the ECP ExaWind application, Nalu-Wind, being visualized using ParaView. Performance data for the run is being visualized using TAU's ParaProf browser with instrumentation hooks inserted in the Kokkos runtime. Spack, Trilinos, Kokkos, TAU, ParaVer, Cinema, and Nalu-Wind are all pre-installed in the E4S AWS image.

Also in October 2020, Version 1 of the E4S Community Policies was announced~\cite{e4s:policies}. The E4S Community Policies will serve as membership criteria for E4S member packages. The E4S Community Policies have their genesis in the xSDK Community Policies, and have a similar purpose. Their purpose is to help address sustainability and interoperability challenges within the complex software ecosystem that ECP ST is a part of.

The process of establishing Version 1 of the E4S Community Policies was a multi-year effort led by the ECP SDK team, including representation from Programming Models and Runtimes, Development Tools, Math Libraries, Data and Vis, and Software Ecosystem and Delivery. This team reviewed the existing xSDK Community Policies and selected those policies that were most generally applicable to all of ECP ST, and not specific to math libraries. From there, the chosen policies were refined and gaps were analyzed.

In addition to the policies shown in Figure~\ref{fig:E4S-Community-Policies-V1} a second list of Future Revision policies was also created. These policies are not currently E4S membership criteria, but will be very seriously considered in future versions. In most cases, these policies require further refinement or planning prior to adoption. The topics that these policies address provide information about likely subject areas for E4S policies going forward and are critical to ongoing communication with the E4S community.

In October 2021, Version 2 of the mapping of products to SDKs was completed. This activity was also led by the SDK team, with significant input from ST leadership. The new list includes several changes to existing SDKs, as well as a new Scientific Workflows SDK. The full listing can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sdk-definition1-0}.

%In January 2019, E4S Release 0.2 was posted to the new external E4S website~\cite{e4s:homepage}. It includes a subset of ECP ST software products, and demonstrates the target approach for future delivery of the full ECP ST software stack. Also available are a number of ECP ST software products that support a Spack package, but are not yet fully interoperable. As the primary purpose of the 0.2 release is demonstrating the ST software stack release approach, not all ECP ST software products were targeted for this release. Software products were targeted primarily based on existing Spack package maturity, location within the scientific software stack, and ECP SDK developer experience with the software.

%E4S release 0.2 is also available through a container release that includes support for Docker, Singularity, Shifter, and Charliecloud. The release allows ECP applications that use MPI to be released in a binary form using libraries from the container. The MPI runtime layer can be substituted during execution with the native MPI (e.g., Intel MPI, Cray MPICH, MVAPICH2) that uses the high-speed inter-node network interconnect.

%The initial set of ECP ST SDKs was finalized in December 2018 after consultation with ECP ST leadership. The make up of the SDKs is expected to evolve over time, but the current definitions provide a basis for beginning to form the associated SDK communities. Figure~\ref{fig:sdk-definition1} illustrates the initial division of ST products into SDKs. Note that the ecosystem group listed is currently not anticipated to become a SDK. Rather, the members of that group will be considered E4S software not associated with a specific SDK and will be responsible only for the general community policies that will apply to all ECP ST products. This is due to the large variety of software included in that group and an anticipated lack of commonality that will lead to additional beneficial community policies. Smaller-scale collaboration between these teams may be encouraged in select cases.

The rightmost column lists products that are not part of an SDK, but are part of Ecosystem group that will also be delivered as part of E4S. The colors denoted in the key map all of the ST products to the ST technical area they are part of.  For example, the xSDK consists of products that are in the Math Libraries Technical area, plus TuckerMPI which is in the Ecosystem and Delivery technical area.}
