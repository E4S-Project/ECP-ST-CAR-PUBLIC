                 been mostly used for topology construction and not for
                 performance improvement. To optimize the performance,
                 in this paper we use graph embedding and node/network
                 architecture discovery modules to match the
                 communication topology of the applications to the
                 physical topology of multi-core clusters with
                 multi-level networks. Micro-benchmark results show
                 considerable improvement in communication performance
                 when using weighted and network-aware mapping. We also
                 show that the implementation can improve communication
                 and execution time of the applications.",
